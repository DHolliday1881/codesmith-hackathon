- When viewed as a Chrome extension, everything goes out of view. I made the following
    CSS edits: 
        - .container {padding: 200px -> 0px}
        - h1 {font-size: 100px -> 70px}

- Chrome extension was throwing an error because we had inline JS on index.html
    to handle the category dropdown. Edits to handle that:
        - Move all the JS to main.js
        - Create id "categorySelector" for button.btn in index.html (the category button)
        - Add selector and click eventListener for categorySelector in main.js
        - Renamed the dropdown function myFunction -> dropdownToggle in main.js

- Added comments on main.js for clarity of each block

- manifest.json didn't work properly
    - Had to change: manifest version, content_scripts url
    - Had to add title
    - Had to add the 'action' for it to popup when clicked
